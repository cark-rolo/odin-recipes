    <h2>A Spicy and Sweet Combo</h2>
    <p>This jalapeño cranberry sauce is moderately spicy, but not overpowering. It also makes a lovely condiment for sandwiches. Leave some jalapeño seeds in if you like it spicier!</p>

    <p>If you enjoy a bit of heat in your dishes, the jalapeño in the cranberry sauce provides a subtle spicy kick without overwhelming the overall flavor.</p>
